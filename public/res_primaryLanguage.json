To validate the idea, we conducted extensive interviews with physicians, securing support from leading doctors at HO’OLA, a prominent Hawaiian network of independent physicians. With guidance from mentors and case studies, we crafted a strong business value proposition, performed competitor analysis in the telehealth space, and created a minimum viable product (MVP). Additionally, we developed a revenue model and expansion strategy, culminating in a final pitch where I presented our vision to stakeholders.",

Unlike traditional teaching platforms, the app concept allows players to upload their videos and get tailored critiques on their techniques, eliminating the need for pre-made videos or static comparisons. I built the app's structure using Firebase for user authentication, data tracking, and media storage, ensuring seamless interactions and efficient video uploads. Using Swift and Xcode, I developed the app with an MVC structure, featuring pages for tennis posts, technique-specific views, creating posts, and tracking coach-player engagement. While the app wasn’t released, you can explore its code on my GitHub or visit my blog for detailed updates on its design and features..",

        "description": "For this project, I collaborated with an STJU applied mathematics professor to address inefficiencies in delivery drones, particularly their frequent need for recharging and limited cargo capacity. Our goal was to reduce the weight of large drone wings using an elastic transportation network optimized for energy efficiency, enabling drones to carry more products over longer periods. By calculating the total elastic potential energy and gravity potential energy of the wings, we minimized the total energy to determine the optimal geometric parameters, such as the radius of internal pipelines. Using MATLAB simulations, we iteratively refined the design, aiming for a structure similar to dragonfly wings, known for their lightweight and efficient design. This work, titled Numerical Algorithm for Transportation Network, was published in the Journal of Applied Mathematics, highlighting our approach to designing significantly lighter and more efficient drone wings.",

        "description": "For this project, I developed a low-cost, computationally efficient assisted driving system for navigating narrow roads with obstacles. Using a Raspberry Pi, Intel Neural Compute Stick, infrared sensors, an ultrasound sensor, and an SSD (Single Shot Detector) detection camera, I built and programmed a Raspbot Car to classify and avoid people, bikes, and vehicles. The system used OpenVINO to process video streams and adjust controls based on real-time object detection results. Testing trials confirmed the car could safely maneuver around objects or stop when necessary, achieving an average of 7.5 FPS. SSD detection proved more efficient than RCNN, Faster RCNN, or YOLO 3.0 for this setup. This project showcases the potential of cost-effective, efficient solutions for assisted driving, and I hope to continue developing custom detection models to enhance its capabilities.",
